## Project Details

### Overview
**Paymint** is an AI-powered sustainable fintech platform that bridges traditional finance, decentralized finance, and blockchain-based sustainability. 
We integrate real time financial data, employ advanced AI and expand into decentralized finance to empower our users to make informed and sustainable investment decisions.

### Problem Statement
Traditional financial platforms often provide only raw market data or isolated ESG metrics, leaving investors without a holistic view of both financial performance and sustainable impact. Moreover, the emerging fields of decentralized finance and blockchain‐based carbon offsets remain disconnected from conventional investment tools, making it difficult for investors to align their portfolios with their environmental values. All finance applications are black box as of now, we aim to give the users the ability to control their owwn data

### Solution
Our project, PayMint, bridges this gap by integrating real‑time financial data, ESG metrics, and blockchain-based carbon offset solutions into a single, unified platform accessible by virtually anyone. By leveraging APIs for live market and sustainability data and an AI-powered analysis engine/chatbot that was built on a quantized Llama model, PayMint delivers personalized investment recommendations. PayMint aims to balance profitability with environmental impact. Additionally, we enable users to track their carbon footprints and directly purchase tokenized carbon offsets on Ethereum, thereby letting investors make informed, sustainable decisions that contribute to a greener future.

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: [React,Tailwind]
- **Backend**: [Flask][solidity][Python]
- **Database**: [SQLite][NoSQL]
- **APIs**: [Yahoo Finance API & ESG API]
- **AI**: [NLP,LLM,GEN-AI]

### Key Features
#### AI-Powered Sustainable Investment Analysis:
Utilizes a quantized Llama-based language model (via llama‑cpp‑python) to deliver context-aware, detailed financial analysis and personalized investment recommendations that balance profitability with eco-friendly alternatives, while maintaining conversation history.

#### Integrated Financial & ESG Dashboard:
We combine real‑time market data with comprehensive ESG metrics, offering investors a unified view of both financial performance and sustainability measures for their portfolios.

#### Carbon Footprint Tracking & Blockchain Offset Purchasing:
Enables users to track their carbon footprint and directly purchase tokenized carbon offsets on Ethereum via smart contracts, hence integrating traditional finance with decentralized, sustainable solutions.

### Running the Project

## Additional Resources

### Project Timeline
#### Phase 1 – Planning & Design
On the train journey to Trivandrum we scoured through sustainable startups and fintech companies for inspiration and finally landed on our idea.

#### Phase 2 - AI Module & Conversation Management
One of the first features to be completed since the problem statement requires it 

#### Phase 3 & 4 - Blockchain & Carbon Offset, Frontend Development & Integration
#### Phase 5 – Deployment
Still working on it :)

### Challenges Faced
_Discuss technical challenges and how you overcame them_
- First time working with blockchain technologies so we had to read a learn and navigate ourselves through the tech in a short span of time
- Due to lack of compute on our side, we had to learn to work with quantized models via yt videos and documentations on the go and made it possible to produce highly accurate results

### Future Enhancements
_Share your vision for future development_

- Full fledged mobile app for expense tracking
- Advanced and comphrehensive screener
- Deployment with good compute and resources

### Submission Checklist
- [*] Completed all sections of this README
- [*] Added project demo video
- [*] Ensured all team members are listed
- [*] Included setup instructions
- [*] Submitted final code to repository
